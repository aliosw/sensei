<p>
	We are excited to release SenseiDB 1.6.0. Since release 1.5.0, we have gained a new committer: <a href="cn.linkedin.com/in/zhaoyonghui" target="_new">Yonghui Zhao</a> from Xiaomi Inc. This release is a joint effort from teams from LinkedIn, Twitter and Xiaomi. 
</p>

<p>
	The theme of this release is big data analytics. We are seeing many instances of Sensei deployed as a big data analytics tool, so we beefed up BQL to support advanced analytics operators, e.g. sum, avg, distinctCount etc. For more information, see <a href="https://senseidb.atlassian.net/browse/SENSEI-284" target="_new">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
	We also cleaned up our backlog of bugs. See details <a href="https://senseidb.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10000&version=10200" target="_new">here</a>.
