<p>
   After months of hard-work, <a href="http://engineering.linkedin.com/open-source/introducing-senseidb-10-open-source-distributed-realtime-semi-structured-database">we are proud to release the first official version of Sensei (v1.0.0)</a>.
</p>
<p>On the day after its release, we already received a pull request, 150 points on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3489658">Hacker News</a> and claimed #1 spot for a while, which drove 23000 page views to our <a href="http://senseidb.com">project page</a> from 8500 unique visitors.</p>
<p>
<p>
   As part of this release, we are dedicating this blog to Sensei technology.

<h2>Architecture Diagram:</h2>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<h4>One-liner:</h4>
<p>
	SenseiDB is a distributed data system optimized for scenarios with rapid updates and complex queries, including full-text search capabilities.
</p>

<p>
	Sensei is used in many places to power LinkedIn.com, powering search pages to analytics products. Most notably the LinkedIn Homepage.
</p>


<h2>What is it NOT?</h2>
<p>
	To clear up some confusions from some comments on Hacker News, Sensei is not meant to replace every features of a RDBMS. As with any systems, design trade-offs were made for the primary problem the system tries to solve:
	<ul>
		<li>Sensei is NOT relational - JOIN operations are not supported. We adopt the philosophy of NOSQL data systems of data to be de-normalized.</li>
		<li>Sensei is NOT transactional - although we provide durability and eventual consistency guarantees, we don't support a full transactional insert model, e.g. roll-back etc.</li>
		<li>Eventual Consistency - Sensei does NOT have the same consistency guarantees that a traditional RDBMS supports. Instead, we guarantee the data to be eventual consistent, e.g. at All nodes will guarantee to converge to a consistent state.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Trying it out</h2>
<p>
	Best way to try out Sensei is start from <a href="http://senseidb.com/gettingStarted.html">getting started page</a> and setup all examples. This way, you can see some of the functionalities Sensei provides.
