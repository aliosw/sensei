	<h2>Glossary</h2>
	<p>
		A list of Sensei vocabularies.
	</p>
</div>


<h2>Broker</h2>
<p>
	A Sensei broker performs scatter-gather logic on query requests. The broker also listens to events from ZooKeeper and maintains a view of partition to node list map which is used to route and scatter query requests. Every node process has a broker co-located.
</p>
<hr/>

<h2>Data Event</h2>
<p>
Data events are units of indexing activities.
</p>

<h2>Data Stream</h2>
<p>
  Stream of data events that Sensei consumes from via Gateways.
</p>
<p>
  Some properties of Data Streams:
<ul>
	<li>Versioned - each event on the stream has a monotonically increasing value indicating a unique point in the stream</li>
	<li>Ordered - ordering of all events should reflect the semantics of the application</li>
</ul> 	
</p>
<hr/>

<h2>Gateway</h2>
<p>
  Gateways are how Sensei consumes from a data stream. The following are some built-in gateways:
<ul>
	<li>File - Streaming of a text file where each line is a json representation of a data event, with each line number as the version. (<a href="https://github.com/senseidb/sensei/tree/master/example/cars/data" target="_blank">Example</a>)</li>
	<li>JMS - Data stream abstraction over a JMS queue.</li>
	<li>JDBC - Data stream abstraction over a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSet.html" target="_blank">ResultSet</a> via a defined <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/sql/PreparedStatement.html" target="_blank">PreparedStatement</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/kafka/" target="_blank">Apache Kafka</a> - Kafka is a fast distributed messaging system. A Kafka data-stream is versioned by offsets, and each message is a data event.</li>
</ul>	
</p>
<p>
  You can write your own Gateway implementation by simply implementing the <a href="https://github.com/senseidb/sensei/tree/master/sensei-core/src/main/java/com/senseidb/gateway/SenseiGateway.java" target="_blank">SenseiGateway</a> interface. And configure it via the <b>sensei.gateway</b> properties.

<h2>Node</h2>
<p>
	A Sensei node is a Java process performing indexing work as handling query requests. A node can be configured to query over N shards.
</p>
<hr/>


<h2>Shard</h2>
<p>
	A partition or slice of the data corpus.
</p>
<hr/>

<h2>Sharding Strategy</h2>
<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/senseidb/sensei/tree/master/sensei-core/src/main/java/com/senseidb/indexing/ShardingStrategy.java" target="_blank">ShardingStrategy</a> interface defines how a data event defined by a JSON object is mapped to a shard.
